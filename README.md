## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

## What I learned

How to structure a simple project and get up and running quickly. Planning the layout and annotating the design comps, using GitHub, including google fonts, naming custom variables and writing CSS reset styles.

BEM. This naming convention is still very popular although might not be as necessary with so many of the newer CSS features that are widely supported today, things like; container queries, nesting and more...

Emmet is still useful/valuable.

How CSS Custom Properties are declared and used properly (eg. `:root` for known variables upfront and on-the-fly like `--gap` for when you notice repetitive values that would benefit from being declared in one place and kept in sync)

Kevin referred to 'base 16' calculations font sizes (eg: font size of 15 px is 16/15 = 0.325rem) and it reminded me of using `CSS calc()` at work for the first time. 

The `grid-areas` needed to be defined inside of the media query. Kevin placed them outside and it took me a while to debug why the layout was broken for mobile screen sizes.

## Continued development

This was a good refresher in building websites from design comps using grid and flexbox. CSS has grown up so much that there is too much to list for me to learn and to remind myself of. Aiming for 4 pomodoros (2 hours) each day.
